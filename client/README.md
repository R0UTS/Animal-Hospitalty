# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

 # Animal Hospitality

## Project Overview

This project is an online platform designed to connect livestock owners with veterinary doctors for emergency assistance. [cite: 1, 2, 3] It enables farmers to report animal health issues, upload media, and receive timely assistance from qualified veterinarians. [cite: 2, 3]

## Installation

To set up and run this project, please follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    ```

    * Replace `<your-repository-url>` with the actual URL of your Git repository.

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd animal-hospitality
    ```

    * Replace `animal-hospitality` with the name of your project directory if it's different.

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install # or yarn install
    ```

    * This command installs all the necessary packages listed in the `package.json` file.

4.  **Set up the database:**

    * Ensure you have MongoDB installed and running.
    * Create a database named `animal-hospitality` (or as you prefer).
    * Update the database connection string in your `.env` file (if you are using one) or directly in your code (not recommended for production).  Example:
        ```javascript
        //  Example using .env
        //  DB_CONNECTION_STRING=mongodb://localhost:27017/animal-hospitality
        ```

5.  **Run the frontend:**

    ```bash
    npm start # or yarn start
    ```

    * This command starts the React development server.

6.  **Run the backend:**

    ```bash
    #  If you have a separate backend server:
    #  cd backend
    #  npm start or yarn start 
    #  (These commands might vary depending on your backend setup)
    ```

    * These commands start your Node.js/Express backend server (if you have one separate from the frontend).  The specific commands might be different depending on your backend setup.

## Technologies Used

* **Frontend:**
    * ReactJS
    * HTML
    * CSS
    * JavaScript
    * React Router (if using routing)
* **Backend:**
    * Node.js
    * Express.js (if using Node.js)
* **Database:**
    * MongoDB
* **Development Tools:**
    * Visual Studio Code
    * Web development extensions
* **Libraries & APIs:**
    * Any other libraries or APIs you used (e.g., location services, messaging services)

## Additional Notes

* Make sure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.
* This setup assumes you have a separate frontend and backend. If they are integrated, you might need to adjust the run commands.
* You might need to configure environment variables (e.g., API keys, database connection strings) before running the application.
* Refer to the documentation of the specific libraries and frameworks you are using for more detailed information.
